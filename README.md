WELCOME TO CHAIRMAN OF THE BORED

Chairman of the Bored is a website designed to provide you with the cures to boredom. 

The homepage consists of a table that the user decides how to end boredom. The navigation dropdown bar guide the 
user through the boredroom. Boredom by numbers, uses the numbers api and it will produce a random fact for every number the user types in or toggles up or down. 
The sign up page consists of a sign up with first name, last name and password have to filled. Regex is used to validate the user is using a valid email address. When signed up the user is sent to the bored room. I will continue to build more bored rooms. HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT were used and linked together. Bored by Numbers and sign up are an interactive forms. Bored by numbers uses ajax to become dynamic.
